# Rules of the 100 Days Of Coding Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will read for at least a 1/2 hour (30 minutes) every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
September 23th, 2019.

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfReading
2. If I read at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
4. I will update the (Log)[r1-log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will code.  The time spent reading aboud coding will NOT count towards this challenge.


## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](r1-log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
